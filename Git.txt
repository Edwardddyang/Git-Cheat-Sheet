Workflow of git: 

1. Working directory (actually coding)
2. Staging (Changes are ready)
3. Commit to local repository 

Step 1 begin: 

To start off: 
git init - Create git repository 

To copy a repository on local machine from Github: 
git clone HTTPS

To see which files have been modified compared to the last commit: 
git status 

Step 2 staging files: 

git add . //Stages the changes in the current director
git add --all //Stages changes in the entire git repository 

Step 3 commit:

git commit -m "Message" 
git reset HEAD~ //This undoes the most recent commit and goes back to the last one, does not
                  delete anything (Safe) 
git log //Displays entire commit history 

git reset //Undoes changes by moving the repository's timeline backwards to a past commit 
  -git reset --soft //Moves commit history back, but keeps changes staged 
  -git reset --mixed //Default, Moves commit history back and unstages any changes 
  -git reset --hard //Moves to last commit history and deletes all changes, effectively hits "Undo" on all your typing since you last ran git commit

git revert <minihash> //Creates a new commit which reverts back to what commit of minihash, difference from reset is that it creates a new commit rather than go back to a previous one 

Branching: 
  - When makes changes to a branch, you have to commit the changes for other branches to not have the changes 
  - Merge conflict: When the same part of the same file is modified differently in different branches

git branch <name> //Creates new branch 
git branch -d <name> //Deletes a branch 
git branch -D <name> //Force deletes a branch 
git checkout <name> //Goes to the branch 
git merge <name> -m "comment" //Merges the changes in name into current directory 

To go back to a past commit: 

git log <name> //Shows every commit in current branch (q to exit)
git log --oneline //Shows just the minihash and the message 
git checkout <minihash> //Goes back to the commit of that minihash (git checkout master/main to go back to main)
git diff <minihash1> <minihash> //Shows the difference in the files of the two different commits 

git restore <filename> //Restores the file back to its previous commit 
git restore . //Restores every file back to its previous commit 

git stash //Allows you to change branches without committing your current branch 
  - git stash pop //Brings the change to the branch you are in, and deletes the stash in the list 
  - git stash apply //Brings the changes to the branch you are in, and keeps the stash in the list 
  - git stash drop //Deletes the newest stash
  - git stash drop stash@{0} //Deletes stash at certain index 
git stash list //Shows all your past stashs 

With Github: 

git push //Sends local changes to Github 
  - git push origin <branchname> 
  - git push -u origin <branchname> //Makes it so for that branch, you only need to do "git push" 

git fetch //Brings remote changes into local repository but no merging 
  - Need to run git merge to see the changes in your local directory 

git pull //Trys to merge your working directory with the Github

Pull Request - A request to merge a branch into the main
