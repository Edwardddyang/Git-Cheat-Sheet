Workflow of git: 

1. Working directory (actually coding)
2. Staging (Changes are ready)
3. Commit to local repository (Files sit in between working director and repository save)

Step 1 begin: 

To start off: 
git init - Create git repository 

To copy a repository on local machine from Github: 
git clone HTTPS

To see which files have been modified compared to the last commit: 
git status 

Step 2 staging files: 

git add . //Stages the changes in the current director
git add --all //Stages changes in the entire git repository 
git reset //Undoes changes by moving the repository's timeline backwards to a past commit 
  -git reset --soft //Moves commit history back, but keeps changes staged 
  -git reset --mixed //Default, Moves commit history back and unstages any changes 
  -git reset --hard //Moves commit history back and deletes all changes
